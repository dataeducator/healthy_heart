        "The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that is capable of accurately identifying individuals at high risk of heart failure based on demographic and clinal data. By harnessing the power of machine learning, Zephyr Healthcare Solutionss aims to signifantly improve patient hospitalizations, and ehannce overal quality of their cardiac care.\n",

        "In the realm diagnostics, timely and accurate diseease detection is crucial to improving patient health outcomes. Zephyr Healthcare recognizes the potential of machine learning techniques in achieving this goal. The challenge lies in developing a robust predictive model that harnesses the power of neural networks or ensemble methods to identify cardiac conditions with a focus on achieving high recall rates.\n",
